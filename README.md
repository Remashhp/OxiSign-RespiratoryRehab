## 📖 Overview
**OxiSign** is a smart health-tech solution designed to assist patients with respiratory conditions (like COPD or post-surgery recovery). Traditional breathing exercises are often boring and repetitive, leading to low patient compliance.

OxiSign solves this by turning therapy into an interactive game controlled by breath intensity, powered by real-time analysis algorithms.

## 💡 Key Features
- **Gamified Therapy:** Control a hot air balloon using breath duration and strength (Simulated in MVP).
- **Visual Feedback:** Real-time visual cues for Inhale/Exhale phases to ensure proper technique.
- **AI Analytics Dashboard:** Post-session analysis providing metrics on breath stability, lung capacity usage, and improvement trends.
- **Customizable Difficulty:** Adjustable parameters for lift power and target duration based on patient condition.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Engine:** Pygame (for rendering and physics simulation)
- **Input:** - *Current MVP:* Mouse click/hold (Simulating Airflow Sensor).
  - *Planned:* Digital Airflow Sensor (Arduino/Serial Integration).

## 🚀 How to Run
Follow these steps to run the simulation on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Remashhp/OxiSign-RespiratoryRehab.git](https://github.com/Remashhp/OxiSign-RespiratoryRehab.git)
   cd OxiSign-RespiratoryRehab
